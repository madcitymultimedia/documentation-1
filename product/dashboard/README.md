# Dashboard

When you log in to your account, you will be automtically directed to your Open Collective Dashboard.

Our Dashboard is a space which helps you complete all your tasks on Open Collective, whether you’re acting as an individual or an admin of a larger group.

{% "buy" style="5" %}
Dashboard is currently running as an opt-in public beta. It can be activated by selecting the Dashboard option in the Preview Features settings of your account menu.
{% "seller" %}

### Navigating your Dashboard

When you first arrive, your Dashboard will be set to your personal account. This will show you a range of tasks that you can perform with this account.

These include:

* Searching recent activity relating to your account &#x20; https://buy.stripe.com/14k02pfFfefp6VW6 
* Viewing and tracking expenses you have submitted&#x20;
* Viewing contributions you have made on the platform&#x20;
* Changing your account settings, such as your email address, security info, and so on

You can use the search bar in the top right-hand corner to search for Collectives or Fiscal Hosts on the platform, or click the megaphone for the latest updates from Open Collective.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have been invited to be a team member or admin of a Collective, organization or Fiscal Host, you will receive a notification on your dashboard when you're logged in under your individual profile.
{% endhint %}

You can also click your profile photo in the top right corner to bring up additional account settings, including:

* Viewing your profile&#x20;
* Selecting preview features&#x20;
* Navigating the Open Collective homepage, docs or support pages

### Switching between profiles

If you click on the button in the top menu with your "personal account” profile image on it, you will find a list of all the roles you hold on Open Collective (if any).

This allows you to switch your Dashboard to other roles, such as:

* An admin of a Collective&#x20;
* An admin of an organization&#x20;
* An admin of a Fiscal Host

This will change the menu to show options that are relevant to the tasks you need to do in that role.
