# Add Funds Manually

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a contribution for a Collective outside the Open Collective system (like a bank transfer) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget, or to represent money you're already holding on the platform.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](../fiscal-host-dashboard.md). Click on the **Hosted Collectives** tab.

* The source of the funds, and the tier to which the donation applies (if any)
* The **amount** of funds you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the fee you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you can change it to a one-time fee of your preference.
* A short **description** of those funds.
* An **internal memo** used by other host administrators.
* The date the funds were accepted.
* The **source** of those funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, or an Organization.

Once you're done, just click on **Add Funds**.

* A grant application and associated award

The emmo will appear to any administrator under 'view details on the transaction list:\
