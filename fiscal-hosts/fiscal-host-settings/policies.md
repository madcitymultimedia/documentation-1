# Policies

## Required Admins

You can use this policy to enforce the minimum number of admins that a collective needs in order to be accepted by your host.

In order to do so, simply select the number of admins you want to enforce. To turn it off, select _Do not enforce a minimum number of admins_.

Note that, after setting a minimum number of admins **you won't be able to approve Pending Applications** from collectives that do not have enough admins. You'll be able to **open an exception** for collectives that already invited enough admins, even though these invitations are still pending.

![You're able to approve applications that have enough invited admins, even if some of the admins are still pending.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (53) (1).png>)

It is also possible to automatically prevent these collectives that have pending admins from receiving contributions with the freeze feature:

In this scenario, if you decide to open an exception to a collective that still doesn't satisfy the minimum number of admins, you'll make sure they only start to raise funds after they have enough signed-up admins.
