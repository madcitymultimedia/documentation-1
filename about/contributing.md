## Code Contributions

Unsure where to begin contributing to Open Collective? You can start by looking through the `good first issues`label, which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

Want to get paid for contributing code? Check out our [bounty program](../contributing/development/bounties.md).

**General guidelines**

* The strings must be internationalized. See [/help/developers/translations](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/translations)
* Whenever it's possible we must use `styled-components` to write styles. See [OC Styleguide](https://styleguide.opencollective.com)
* Icons must be imported from the [styled-icons](http://styled-icons.js.org) library.
* Tests written with Cypress must follow our [good practices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/testing-with-cypress) conventions.

### Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests into smaller chunks. If it's a bug fix, it will probably be quickly merged and deployed. If it's a new feature, it will need more testing and review.
