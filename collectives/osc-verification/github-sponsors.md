# Setting up GitHub Sponsors

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are hosted by Open Source Collective and would like to connect GitHub Sponsors, [please see this guide](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/github-sponsors).&#x20;

To confirm that your Collective has a fiscal host, and the fiscal host is **Open Source Collective**, see this on your Collective's home page:

If you have another fiscal host you will need to choose Fiscal Host: Other when signing up for GitHub Sponsors and work with your fiscal host to get their bank account and tax information.
